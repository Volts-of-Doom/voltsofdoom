Notes on running this version:

Resources are expected in <user.home>/AppData/Roaming/voltsofdoom, as follows:

- /mods and /img directories from the Examples section
- /resources/adventure and /resources/levelmap from the Examples section.

IntelliJ config currently does not allow code to run without re-running from the command line.
