# The Core System for Volts of Doom
This code is the backbone of Volts of Doom, and is required for the game to run. 
It contains all of the loading and main classes, though the Volts of Doom Core Game 'fleshes out' these into a true game.
That said, the Core Game is not required for Volts of Doom to run, if mods are installed to add gameplay.
